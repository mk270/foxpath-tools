FoXPath

Authors: Ben Webb, Mark Brough, Martin Keegan

FoXPath is a toy wrapper language for XPath1.0, for those who don't want
to use XQuery.

This code is currently AGPL as it was initially developed as part of a
vertically-integrated web app; the current maintainers are investigating
rewriting, or getting the right to relicense, the AGPL-covered part such
that it may be more readily be used in a library; the affected code is
the version of foxpath/mapping.py checked in in the first commit to github
(effectively the contents of core.py).
